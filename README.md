## NFT Auction Dapp

This project implements an ERC721 contract, an auction contract, and a payment splitter contract to auction NFTs. In order to auction NFTs from an ERC721 contract the owner of the ERC721 contract must approve the auction contract to list those NFTs for sale. The royalties and payments can then be withdrawn from the ERC721 contract to the payment splitter contract in order to disburse funds between several parties.

This dapp:

- Deploys an ERC721 contract
- Deploys an auction contract
- Deploys a payment splitter contract
- Implements a UI to interact with the auction contract
- Allows bidding on approved NFTs
- Integrates with MetaMask

> This project was built using Solidity, Hardhat, ethers.js, React, and the Rinkeby Testnet.
