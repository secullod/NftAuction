## NFT Auction Dapp

This project implements an ERC721 contract in conjunction with an auction contract to auction NFTs. In order to auction NFTs from an ERC721 contract the owner of the ERC721 contract must approve the auction contract to list those NFTs for sale.

With ProjectChain you can:

- Deploy an ERC721 contract
- Deploy an auction contract
-
- Receive payments on invoices with ether
- View project profitability via a profit and loss statement

> This project was built using Solidity, Hardhat, ethers.js, React, and the Rinkeby Testnet.
